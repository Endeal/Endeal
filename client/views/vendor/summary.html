            Vendor is a new iOS point-of-sales app with a forward-thinking approach to selling goods.
            Presently, POS systems are focused on intricate, complex software, designed to be managed
            and learned by employees. But what if instead of having to wait for these employees, customers could
            place their orders directly into your system?
            <br/><br/>
            Through the Patron app, customers
            instantly have access to your entire menu from their smartphones, and can place orders
            and give feedback independent of your front-facing employee's availability. Patrons get
            the benefit of ordering anywhere, anytime, bypassing lines, and having a smooth interface
            to browse your menu. You benefit from the added efficiency of workers no longer having
            to listen to customers relay their orders for them to input into the system; you can also
            get data on the specific habits
            and tastes of specific customers. This avenue also enables an improved social 
            media presence, as patrons can share your business and their favorite orders with their 
            friends, which nets your business valuable advertising via word of mouth.
            <br/><br/>
            Vendor supports all OPOS-compliant cash registers and receipt
            printers, all HID compliant barcode scanners, and allows you to select any one of
            18 different merchant gateways. This gives you the ability to decide which gateway
            provides the best rates for your business. With our CardFlight integration, traditional 
            debit/credit card transactions via swipe or key-in are a breeze. Vendor is fully 
            EMV-compliant and PCI-compliant; our databases and servers run modern software on
            SSD-based distributed cloud servers; our API is secured with SSL and advanced hashing
            algorithms for sensitive information;
            Stripe and CardFlight, highly trusted frontrunners in the payments space, handle 
            card encryption and financial data storage.
            <br/><br/>
            Lots more is on the horizon for Vendor, so stay tuned!
