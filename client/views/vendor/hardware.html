    <h4>Barcode/QR Code Scanner:</h4>
    <p class="flow-text">
    We highly recommend a QR Code scanner to quickly verify pickup and self-serve orders.
    When a customer places an order for pickup, you will be notified in the Vendor app.
    When you finish preparing the order, a simple tap in Vendor will notify the Patron
    that they can pickup their order. To identify which order belongs to a Patron, you'll
    scan a QR code that appears on their phone.<br/>
    <b>Please note</b>, a powered USB hub is also required to use a barcode/QR code scanner
    with Vendor. Any 2-dimensional USB HID compliant barcode
    scanner should work, but only the following have been fully tested:<br/><br/>

    sturdy and should last for at least 2 years, depending on how heavily used it is.
    It is bi-directional, encrypted, has excellent battery life, and supports both
    EMV card transactions and traditional magnetic stripe transactions. EMV-Ready
    Chip Card Readers can be purchased for $60 here:<br/><br/>

    and the receipt printer plugs into the BluePro. The cash drawer alternatively can plug directly
