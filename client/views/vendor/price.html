    Vendor is free to download and create an account. There are no
    monthly fees, installation fees, or licensing fees. You can
    use it on an unlimited number of devices.<br/><br/>
    We charge 0.2% of the total price of an order placed over Patron.
    This is on top of the amount Stripe charges: as of now, that is
    2.9% + $0.30. This price reduces as Vendor processes a higher
    volume of orders. The total charge for a Patron-based order is
    3.1% + $0.30<br/><br/>
    We charge 0.5% of the total price of an order placed over
    credit/debit cards. This is on top of the amount your
    payment gateway charges- you can select between 18 different
    payment gateways to find one that best suits your business.
    For example, if your selected gateway charges
    1.0% + $0.08 per card transaction, the total charge for a
    card-based order is 1.5% + $0.08<br/><br/>
    There is no charge placed on cash-based transactions.
