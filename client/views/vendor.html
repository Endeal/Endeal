            <p class="flow-text">
            There are a lot of point of sales systems out there that do a lot of different things,
            but none can provide what we provide. The term point-of-sales refers to the fact that
            the terminal becomes the spot where sales happen for your business. But Vendor is a
            full blown sales platform- being a point of sales system is just one of its features.
            <br/><br/>
            Vendor probably has everything you want out of your traditional POS system- menu and
            order management, sales and financial data, employee management & restricted access,
            support for the traditional bevy of equipment (receipt printers, cash drawers, credit/debit
            card readers)- but where it really looks to send your business to the next level is with
            its Patron app integration.
            <br/><br/>
            Patron is an app for consumers that gets you connected directly to them. Instead of relying
            on an army of front-counter employees to manage customer money, feedback, administrate reward
            systems and coupon promotions, why not let technology do it for you? Customers relish in
            the time and convenience of being able to buy from right from their phone, and you save
            costs on employees and managing a series of fragmented systems.
            <br/><br/>
            In addition to potentially changing the way customers purchase from your business,
            we can offer deeper analysis of consumer purchases over than anyone else can, because we
            can distinguish any purchase made through Patron at a personalized level. Figure out specific
            customer needs, whether it be their addiction to your grilled cheese sandwiches being
            doubled when you start sending them coupons for it or by discovering they stopped
            buying sodas from you when you raised the price 25 cents.
            <br/><br/>
            Lots more is on the horizon for Vendor, so stay tuned!
