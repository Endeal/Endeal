            &bull; Simply walk into a bar/restaurant/store/etc. and start the app to see their full menu. You can order anything off this menu, give a tip if you want, send a message to accompany it, and choose which table to serve it to or which counter to pick it up at. Get a notification as soon as your order is ready and track its progress every step of the way.
            <br/>
            &bull; Throw out your pile of plastic rewards cards and let the app track, earn, and automatically apply points for you.
            <br/>
            &bull; Share your orders and favorite places on social media, earning more points while you do it.
